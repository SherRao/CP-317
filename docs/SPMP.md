<h1>Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)</h1>
<p>
The basic template to be used is derived from IEEE Std 1058-1998, IEEE Standard for Software
Project Management Plans. The following is a template for the SPMP. It begins with a cover page
that contains the version control and release information. Each section has a description of the
information contained within.
