<h3>1.1 Project Overview</h3>
<p>MuSpace is a music-based social media platform focused on connecting music fans with one another and allowing them to share their tastes with the world. Each MuSpace user will be provided with a personal feed to post about songs, albums, artists, and playlists that they are interested in. When users share similar listening habits with others, they are recommended as connections via a point-based rating system using the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank">Spotify API</a> and <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/#about-the-sdk" target="_blank">Spotify SDK</a> data. MuSpace will also offer listening rooms that allow users to listen along with their friends and chat with each other in real-time. Additionally, users can recommend which songs will be played in the listening room.</p>
