<h3>2. Project Organization</h3>

<h4>2.1 Organizational Structure</h4>
<p>Using the agile approach, we will be starting on the backend of the project and the UI design as a group. As soon as the UI design is finished and layed out, the frontend developers will begin working. Everything worked on will be done through scrums. After the bulk of the project is finished, we will move the web-based application onto Android and iOS.</p>

<h3>3. Managerial Process</h3>

<h4>3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities</h4>
<p>The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that will eventually branch out to Android and iOS, which uses Spotify API to connect people listening to the same genre of music and the same artists. By the end of the term (August, 5th 2021), our goal is to have all project deliverables - the Requirements, GUI Prototype, SPMP, and Design) complete, as well as completed a well implemented version of our application, which should also be Quality Tested heavily. This project's major priority is to have an easy-to-understand, easy-to-read, and informative set of documentation as well as a seamless project flow. Because the project has no monetary funding, the completion of our deliverables is solely dependent on our resources and time.</p>

<h4>3.2 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</h4>
<p>Our group meetings take place every Tuesday and Thursday during lectures, where we send one person to listen to the lecture. During this time, we split into groups for sprints, where work ethic is peer checked.</p>
<p>All calls are done via Discord (as in person is not applicable), Documentation is done on Google Docs, UI on Figma, and using Github as the repository.</p>
<p>SQA is conducted when sprints are done. The process is conducted by those not in the sprint to ensure that quality control is unbiased.</p>
